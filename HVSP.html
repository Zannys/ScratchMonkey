<h2>High Voltage Serial Programming</h2>

<img class=circuit src="img/arduino_prog_hvsp.svg">

<p>HVSP is the high voltage protocol for 8- and 14-pin ATtiny MCUs.</p>

<h3>Connecting your Arduino</h3>

<p>HVSP requires 7 signals (including power and ground), as shown in this illustration. For High Voltage programming, the timing of the power pin matters, so it is software controlled through the <strong>SVCC</strong> pin, rather than simply through the <strong>5V</strong> pin of the Arduino. The <strong>HVRESET</strong> signal is used to control one of the circuits shown in the <a href="HighVoltage.html">High Voltage programming section</a> to generate the 12V signal to be applied to <strong>RESET</strong> pin of the target microcontroller. The other signals go directly to the target microcontroller.</p>
 
<h3>Connecting your Target Microcontroller</h3>

<p>The HVSP signals need to be connected to the corresponding signals on your target microcontroller / board. Details for each target are discussed in the <a href="Connection.html">Connection Diagrams</a> chapter.</p>
